## Robot1(Attack)
### Members
Romina Aalishah: PID controller, ball tracking, defend and attack algorithm
Arshia Esmail Tehrani: PID controller, ball tracking, defend and attack algorithm
tasks were done by both.

### Purpose
In this code, the robot shoots the ball to the opponent goal.

### Strategy
The robot first moves to the back of the ball. The direction is set to the opponent goal. And the robot moves to make the ball move.

### Controller
PID controller is used in order to make the steady-state error minimum, fast response (short rise time), no oscillations and higher stability. Also ZOH method used for descritization.

### Creativity
The robot only sets the angle and the moves to the desired position to use less data and time.

## Robot2(Defend)
### Members
Romina Aalishah: PID controller, ball tracking, defend and attack algorithm
Arshia Esmail Tehrani: PID controller, ball tracking, defend and attack algorithm
tasks were done by both.

### Purpose
In this code, the robot defends the ball to not let the opponent shoot.

### Strategy
The robot first moves to the back of the ball. The direction is set to ones goal. And the robot moves to not let the ball be shoot.

### Controller
PID controller is used in order to make the steady-state error minimum, fast response (short rise time), no oscillations and higher stability. Also ZOH method used for descritization.

### Creativity
The robot only sets the angle and the moves to the desired position to use less data and time.
